# Weather Application
### Status: Completed

This is the first Android application I made. This simple application uses data from OpenWeather API and displays it on the screen when the app is opened. It displays the current weather at a specific location, as well as a 5-day forecast. 

The program is written in Java using Android Studio. You can find video demonstration below.

# Installation
To try this application, download [**weather-app.apk**](weather-app.apk) in this repo, and transfer it to your device's storage. Then open up the .apk file inside your device to install. Make sure to give the application relevant permissions for it to run properly.

# Storage Permission
Since this is the first application I wrote, I used a method where the downloaded files need to use storage permissions.
